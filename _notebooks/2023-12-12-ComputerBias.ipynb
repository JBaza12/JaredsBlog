    "## <mark>Introduction to Computing Bias</mark>\n",
    "A brief introduction to computing biases is that human biases are usually incorporated into algorithms or data. If this is confusing to understand, here is one example. When you are browsing Netflix and look at the different categories, you see that typically there are a bunch of Netflix exclusives being displayed more than non-exclusives. This is a form of computing bias as this would benefit Netflix, as the movie or show will never leave Netflix. So, if you get hooked on that show, then you will inevitably keep paying the Netflix subscription."

    "Another bias can be observed in trends. In the context of an app that collects information for loan officers to help them decide who the best candidate is to give a loan to, trends, for example, could show that a certain age group is comprised of better candidates for a loan. This bias is based on trends and data, and it could be beneficial to the loan officers, preventing them from losing money on loans and avoiding complications with the loanee. However, this could be harmful to the candidate applying for the loan because they might be turned away simply because they don't qualify within a certain age or race bracket."

    "The implementation of a predictive policing algorithm in a city has raised concerns regarding potential biases,leading to disporotionate targeting of specific neighborhoods. This over-policing could result in civil rights violation. Your task is to propose a solution to mitigate this bias and explain the method you'd use to remove computing bias. Make a full paragraph that is at least 4 sentences\n",

    "To make sure the predictive policing is fair, we should regularly check it with a diverse group of people. It's important to listen to the community, hear what they think, and involve them in the process. Training police officers on how the system works and potential issues is also very important. By working together, getting feedback, and talking openly, we can make the system fairer for everyone 👍👍👍."
