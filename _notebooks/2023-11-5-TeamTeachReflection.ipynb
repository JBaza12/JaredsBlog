    "## Plan for Quiz\n",
    "> For this quiz, in order to prepare, I plan on reviewing each of the team teaches(accesible through my student each blog page) and read/go through them to solodify my understading on each one. Then, if I still have questions, I will go to college board and watch the vieos for better support. I will go through the quiz and write down the questions I needed help on and write a sentence or two on why is was difficult and what I learned from it. Sort of like a quick reflection on each of the problems I couldn't do."
