    "What is Pseudo Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo code is a simplified, human-readable representation of a program's logic. It serves as a bridge between our thoughts and actual code, helping us plan and design programs effectively. Think of it as a rough draft of your code, focusing on the \"what\" rather than the \"how.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Pseudo Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarity: Pseudo code allows us to express our ideas clearly before diving into coding. It helps in understanding complex algorithms.\n",
    "Planning: Before writing real code, pseudo code helps in outlining the program's structure.\n",
    "Collaboration: It's a universal language understood by programmers, making it easier to collaborate.\n",
    "Basic Elements of Pseudo Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: Declare variables with meaningful names and types.\n",

    "Copy code\n",
    "READ age FROM USER\n",
    "DISPLAY \"You entered: \" + age\n",
    "Conditions: Use IF statements for decision-making.\n",

    "Copy code\n",
    "IF age >= 18 THEN\n",
    "    DISPLAY \"You are an adult.\"\n",
    "ELSE\n",
    "    DISPLAY \"You are a minor.\"\n",
    "END IF\n",
    "Loops: Plan loops with clear entry and exit conditions.\n",

    "Pseudo Code in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo code often resembles the actual code closely. Here's a Python example and its corresponding pseudo code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def calculate_sum(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are a minor.\")\n",
    "Pseudo Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "FUNCTION calculate_sum(a, b)\n",
    "    RETURN a + b\n",
    "END FUNCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "READ age FROM USER\n",
    "IF age >= 18 THEN\n",
    "    DISPLAY \"You are an adult.\"\n",
    "ELSE\n",
    "    DISPLAY \"You are a minor.\"\n",
    "END IF\n",
    "In this example, you can see how the pseudo code closely mirrors the Python code. The pseudo code focuses on the program's logic without getting into specific syntax details.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's pseudo code in a nutshell! It's a fantastic tool for planning, understanding, and communicating the logic of your programs. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, pseudo code can significantly enhance your programming journey."
