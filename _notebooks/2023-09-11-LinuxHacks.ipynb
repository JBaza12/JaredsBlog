    "- File Cleanup Check: The script checks if a file named sample.md exists. If it does, it deletes it to start fresh.\n",

    "- Appending Text Using echo:Similar to writing more lines in the document. More lines are added to the sample.md file, extending the list of items.\n",
    "- Loop to Generate Actions: Imagine making a list of actions you can do. The script creates a list of actions and descriptions, like \"ls: list-directory.\" It adds these actions to the list in the sample.md file.\n",
    "- Display File Listing and Word Count: Like checking the properties of a file. The script shows you details about the sample.md file, such as its size and the number of words in it.\n",
    "- Render Markdown Using mdless (Optional): This part is like having a program that can display how the document looks. It tries to show you how the Markdown document would appear if it were formatted nicely. But you might need to install something for this to work.\n",
    "- Cleanup: Cleaning up is like throwing away rough notes after you've finished using them. The script deletes the temporary sample.md file because it's done using it."
