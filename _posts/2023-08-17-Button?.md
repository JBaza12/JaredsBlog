<font size="+3">Here is how I made a button</font>
<hr>
- I got this idea from my friend and he showed me how to make a button that, when pressed, simply just displayed a text that was coded to say
- ex:
<button type="button" onclick="alert('Hello! You clikced the button')">Click me!</button>
- Understanding this code allowed me to realize that I could make the button that would go to an external link. 
- ex:
<button onclick = "window.location.href='https://www.google.com/search?q=minesweeper&oq=&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59j0i271l2.1437j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on';">Minesweeper(Click Me!)</button>
- Right now, that is where I am at, but I am sure you can do so much more with these buttons.
