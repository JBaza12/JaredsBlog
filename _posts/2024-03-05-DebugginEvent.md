- I began by debugging the backend and set a breakpoint at the beginning of my code and then I stepped over until my data showed again.<br>
- These screen shots show how the information comes up after a certain amount of breaks in my code. This also shows that data that comes up a certain amount of breaks.

- These two screenshots show my breakpoints and what happends when I debugg the frontend. It also shows the break at the fetch line.<br>
- The video shows how I stepped through the lines of code in my frontend and how the backend reacted to each step. I continued to step the frontend until the data finally apeared in my website.
