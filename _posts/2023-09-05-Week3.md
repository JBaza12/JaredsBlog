- Step one: make a plan
- Once the plan is made, we will go talk/collaberate with another group about our plan.
- First off, me and my partner have to choose what are we going for the Pair Showcase this week. We have decided to do option two in which we will make a big project to present for this pair showcase. 
- Now, we must brainstorm a project to do, such as a game or a interactive site we can make. Just to throw something out there, we could possibly make a all our codes about one specific topic, such as soccer and maybe add a game or two about soccer. 
- After discussing with my partner, we've decided to make our codes all in the genre of music

- Feedback From Other Groups
Lincoln and Ishan- Give more detail about what game you will make and more about how you will make the game and table.
