<font size="+3">Problems I Faced</font>
<hr>
- This week was pretty straightforward, but there was still some mistakes that I had to fix. The first mistake I faced was trying to transfer everything to my new website. When doing so, I realized that for some reason one of my photos was not working. This was a simple fix as I went to my file explorer and found the image and dragged it into my new website. 
- The next problem I faced was trying to customize my snake game. I wanted to try and change the color of everything, but I was went through the code I did not understand any of it. So, I went to ChatGPT to tell me how all this code worked. As ChatGPT ran me through the code, I began to understand how this snake game works. With this new information, I was able to find the line of code to change the color of the background, the apple, and the snake. 
- The last problem I faced was trying to create a new .md file. This was fairly simple and I was able to make a new file and title it "Tester.md." I didn't realize that I needed to have a year, month, and day in my title. My partner Ashwin pointed out this mistake and this allowed me to finnaly customize my student blog.
