<font size="+3">Problems I Faced</font>
<hr>
- This week was pretty straightforward, but there was still some mistakes that I faced. The first mistake I faced was trying to transfer everything to my new website. When doing so, I realized that for some reason one of my photos was not working. This was a simple fix as I went to my file explorer and found the image and dragged it into my new website.
