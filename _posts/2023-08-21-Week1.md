<font size="+3">Outline of what I wanted to complete in week 1, Aug 21-25.</font>
<hr>
 - This week, I want to complete many things. The first being is to get my webiste up and running with no problems. I want to be able to get my webiste working in order to further move on
 - Once I get my website running, I aim to completely change my website to fit my personality and how I would like it to look. I will change everything from the theme to adding images to the home page.
