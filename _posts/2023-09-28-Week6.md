## What we completed
- This week, we completed the Web Programming basics test. We first copied everything from the teacher repository and began to read throught the hacks. We then began to understand what we needed to complete and we got to work
- First, we split up the work in order to be efficient and finnish all the hacks in time. We each completed one hack and then grouped back together to explain each code to make sure we each knew what we were doing. Once we finnished that, we finnished up all the codes and got took advice from other groups. We got comments from other groups and used these comments to additionally fix our code.
## Problems we faced
- The main problem we faced was adding the JS debugging file. This file was extremely weird and hard to deal with. Me and Aswhin were able to add the file to our website but it doesn't show up on the page. Ronit and Vance both have it on their website but it was giving them a lot of problems, and at some point, it broke both of their websites.
